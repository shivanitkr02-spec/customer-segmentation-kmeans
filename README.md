- Feature Scaling (StandardScaler)
- Elbow Method for optimal cluster selection
- Data Visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn

## Key Insights
- Identified premium, regular, and price-sensitive customer segments
- High-income high-spending customers form the most valuable group
- Results can support targeted marketing strategies

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
